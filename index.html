        <p>Computer Science and Maths have always been an interesting topic to study, <br>
            which is I have decided to obtain the Associate's of Science in Computer Science degree to further my knowledge in the field. <br>

              <div class="col"><p>Born in San Antonio, Texas and raised in many different places such as Germany, Georgia, Texas, Illinois, and Missouri, 
                  I was made to understand different cultures and different people. I am grateful for having this experience as a child as it allowed me to broaden my knowledge of the world I live in
                  which eventually left me more curious than ever. One thing it did not help, however, was my education. Constantly being on the move took a toll due to how different teaching was structured 
                in each of the places I lived. This led me to be behind in my studies come high school, especially in math. I originally disliked the subject, but as I became better towards the latter half of my 
            high school career, I was really starting to enjoy it. I wanted to use math in a useful way, so I decided to take a computer science class my junior year of school. This class is what made me more invested in 
        the study of computer science.</p></div>
